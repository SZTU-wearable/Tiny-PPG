## Project Introduction

PPG (Photoplethysmography) is a non-invasive technique used to measure heart rate and blood oxygen saturation. It typically employs optical sensors to capture changes in blood flow beneath the skin. However, when performing PPG measurements on edge devices, interference from device motion often results in motion artifacts. The Tiny-PPG project aims to address this issue by providing a lightweight neural network solution capable of real-time detection of motion artifacts in PPG signals. The goal is to deploy this solution on edge devices for testing.

## File Descriptions

- `model.py`: This file contains the definition and structure of the Tiny-PPG model.
    
- `Contrast_loss.py` and `Contrast_loss_mem.py`: These files contain code for contrastive loss functions, with the `mem` version introducing a memory bank to enhance contrastive learning process.
    
- `train_contrast.ipynb` and `train_contrast_mem.ipynb`: These two Jupyter Notebooks contain code for model training, with the `mem` version utilizing the memory bank during training.
    
- `Tsne_Visualization.ipynb`: This Jupyter Notebook is designed for visualizing feature vectors during training to facilitate an understanding of the model's learning progress.
    
- `verification.ipynb`: This Jupyter Notebook incorporates code for model validation, enabling the evaluation of model performance.
    
- `data`: This folder contains the dataset used for model training, validation and test.
    
- `PPG`: This folder contains the project files for deploying and testing the model on STM32F7.
